  abstract  = {The history of wheat domestication and use is closely linked to the efforts of humans to protect themselves from hunger and gain control over their food supply. Now grown worldwide wheat has become the most important source of food. For centuries bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) and durum wheat (Triticum durum) have been cultivated in the West to provide humans with energy and essential nutrients. Today China and India are the top two wheat-producing countries, largely because wheat has the advantage of requiring less water for cultivation than other comparable crops while being the main ingredient of a variety of processed foods valued in modern, mainly urban life. For more than a century, breeders have continuously improved wheat focusing on factors affecting grain yield and, more recently, technological quality. The properties of wheat that are ideal for processing into different food products have been greatly improved since the 1960s thanks to detailed research on storage proteins, which constitute the gluten. Most of these genetic successes are referred to in this book but many important goals remain to be achieved. Today further progress is crucial in the use of shared genetic resources, common analytical protocols for allele identification and technological processing, and dedicated tools for analysing polymer formation and characterisation particularly in response to climatic and other environmental factors. Technological properties are not the only wheat quality attributes, as consumers are increasingly aware and concerned about the nutritional value (the content in fiber, minerals, macro- and micro-nutrients, vitamins) and the health impact, whether positive or negative. For example, research on several pathologies associated with the consumption of gluten-based products will require collaboration between allergy specialists and wheat protein geneticists.},

  abstract = {Plant phenotyping investigates how a plant's genome, interacting with the environment, affects the observable traits of a plant (phenome). It is becoming increasingly important in our quest towards efficient and sustainable agriculture. While sequencing the genome is becoming increasingly efficient, acquiring phenotype information has remained largely of low throughput. Current solutions for automated image-based plant phenotyping, rely either on semi-automated or manual analysis of the imaging data, or on expensive and proprietary software which accompanies costly hardware infrastructure. While some attempts have been made to create software applications that enable the analysis of such images in an automated fashion, most solutions are tailored to particular acquisition scenarios and restrictions on experimental design. In this paper we propose and test, a method for the segmentation and the automated analysis of time-lapse plant images from phenotyping experiments in a general laboratory setting, that can adapt to scene variability. The method involves minimal user interaction, necessary to establish the statistical experiments that may follow. At every time instance (i.e., a digital photograph), it segments the plants in images that contain many specimens of the same species. For accurate plant segmentation we propose a vector valued level set formulation that incorporates features of color intensity, local texture, and prior knowledge. Prior knowledge is incorporated using a plant appearance model implemented with Gaussian mixture models, which utilizes incrementally information from previously segmented instances. The proposed approach is tested on Arabidopsis plant images acquired with a static camera capturing many subjects at the same time. Our validation with ground truth segmentations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in the literature shows that the proposed method is able to handle images with complicated and changing background in an automated fashion. An accuracy of 96.7% (dice similarity coefficient) was observed, which was higher than other methods used for comparison. While here it was tested on a single plant species, the fact that we do not employ shape driven models and we do not rely on fully supervised classification (trained on a large dataset) increases the ease of deployment of the proposed solution for the study of different plant species in a variety of laboratory settings. Our solution will be accompanied by an easy to use graphical user interface and, to facilitate adoption, we will make the software available to the scientific community.},

Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100{\textendash}110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, \~{}1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO2-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching \~{}3 Gt y-1 and N use \~{}250 Mt y-1 by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only \~{}0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of \~{}1 Gt y-1, and global N use of \~{}225 Mt y-1. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

  abstract = {Crop production needs to increase in a sustainable manner to meet the growing global demand for food. To identify crop varieties with high yield potential, plant scientists and breeders evaluate the performance of hundreds of lines in multiple locations over several years. To facilitate the process of selecting advanced varieties, an automated framework was developed in this study. A hyperspectral camera was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect aerial imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution in a fast, cost-effective manner. Aerial images were captured in two consecutive growing seasons from three experimental yield fields composed of hundreds experimental wheat lines. The grain of more than thousand wheat plots was harvested by a combine, weighed, and recorded as the ground truth data. To investigate the yield variation at sub-plot scale and leverage the high spatial resolution, plots were divided into sub-plots using image processing techniques integrated by domain knowledge. Subsequent to extracting features from each sub-plot, deep neural networks were trained for yield estimation. The coefficient of determination for predicting the yield was 0.79 and 0.41 with normalized root mean square error of 0.24 and 0.14 g at sub-plot and plot scale, respectively. The results revealed that the proposed framework, as a valuable decision support tool, can facilitate the process of high-throughput yield phenotyping by offering the possibility of remote visual inspection of the plots as well as optimizing plot size to investigate more lines in a dedicated field each year.},

For testing large number of germplasms under complete block design not much suitable because their assumption to accommodate all the treatment combination in each block that increase the size of experiment and reduce the accuracy. To avoid this constraint the present experiment was designed with objective to realise the suitability of alpha lattice design (ALD) over randomised complete block design (RCBD) in plant breeding experiments. The present experiment was conducted in ALD of 8{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}20 i.e. eight blocks each with 20 genotypes in two replications under rainfed and restricted irrigated conditions to estimate the drought tolerance indices. Nine drought tolerance indices were estimated using the data of rainfed and restricted irrigated conditions. These drought tolerance indices were subjected to analysis of variances of both the designs ALD and RCBD to know the efficiency of ALD over RCBD. The relative efficiency of trials shows that ALD was more efficient than RCB design. Based on grain yield per plant under both the conditions twenty-one tolerant genotypes and eleven susceptible genotypes were identified. Identified tolerant and susceptible genotypes can be used for development of mapping populations and for QTLs mapping programme for drought tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).},

abstract = {A major challenge for crop research in the 21st century is how to predict crop performance as a function of genetic architecture. Advances in “next generation” DNA sequencing have greatly improved genotyping efficiency and reduced genotyping costs. Methods for characterizing plant traits (phenotypes), however, have much progressed more slowly over the past 30 years, and constraints in phenotyping capability limit our ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits, especially those related to harvestable yield and stress tolerance. As a case in point, mapping populations for major crops may consist of 20 or more families, each represented by as many as 200 lines, necessitating field trials with over 20,000 plots at a single location. Investing in the resources and labor needed to quantify even a few agronomic traits for linkage with genetic markers in such massive populations is currently impractical for most breeding programs. Herein, we define key criteria, experimental approaches, equipment and data analysis tools required for robust, high-throughput field-based phenotyping (FBP). The focus is on simultaneous proximal sensing for spectral reflectance, canopy temperature, and plant architecture where a vehicle carrying replicated sets of sensors records data on multiple plots, with the potential to record data throughout the crop life cycle. The potential to assess traits, such as adaptations to water deficits or acute heat stress, several times during a single diurnal cycle is especially valuable for quantifying stress recovery. Simulation modeling and related tools can help estimate physiological traits such as canopy conductance and rooting capacity. Many of the underlying techniques and requisite instruments are available and in use for precision crop management. Further innovations are required to better integrate the functions of multiple instruments and to ensure efficient, robust analysis of the large volumes of data that are anticipated. A complement to the core proximal sensing is high-throughput phenotyping of specific traits such as nutrient status, seed composition, and other biochemical characteristics, as well as underground root architecture. The ability to “ground truth” results with conventional measurements is also necessary. The development of new sensors and imaging systems undoubtedly will continue to improve our ability to phenotype very large experiments or breeding nurseries, with the core FBP abilities achievable through strong interdisciplinary efforts that assemble and adapt existing technologies in novel ways.},

Conventional two-band vegetation indices based on red and near-infrared relationships such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are well known to suffer from saturation at moderate-to-high LAI values (3–5). To bypass this saturation effect, in this work a robust alternative has been proposed for the estimation of green LAI over a wide variety of crop types. By using data from European Space Agency (ESA) campaigns SPARC 2003 and 2004 (Barrax, Spain) experimental LAI values over 9 different crop types have been collected while at the same time spaceborne imagery have been acquired using the hyperspectral CHRIS (Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor onboard PROBA (Project for On-Board Autonomy) satellite. This extensive dataset allowed us to evaluate the optimal band combination through spectral indices based on normalized differences. The best linear correlation against the experimental LAI dataset was obtained by combining the 674nm and 712nm wavebands. These wavelengths correspond to the maximal chlorophyll absorption and the red-edge position region, respectively, and are known to be sensitive to the physiological status of the plant. Contrary to the NDVI (r2: 0.68), the red-edge NDI correlated strongly (r2: 0.82) with LAI without saturating at larger values. The index has been subsequently validated against field data from the 2009 SEN3EXP campaign (Barrax, Spain) that again spanned a wide variety of crop types. A linear relationship over the full LAI range was confirmed and the regression equation was applied to a CHRIS/PROBA image acquired during the same campaign. A LAI map has been derived with an RMSE accuracy of 0.6. It is concluded that the red-edge spectral index is a powerful alternative for LAI estimation and may provide valuable information for precision agriculture, e.g. when applied to high spatial resolution imagery.},

Vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to leaf area index (LAI), such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), have been widely used for crop yield prediction. However, chlorophyll content is the key component for crops to convert light energy to organics in the process of photosynthesis, and crop yield may be more accurately predicted by remote sensing models based on a spectral index sensitive to chlorophyll content, such as the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). In this study, we investigated the potential of MTCI for crop yield prediction. Firstly, the MTCI and the NDVI products in Henan Province, China, from 2003 to 2011 with a temporal resolution of half a month were calculated from the daily level-2 reduced resolution ENVISAT MERIS reflectance product (MER\_RR\_2P) using a Maximum Value Composite algorithm. Secondly, we established winter wheat prediction models based on MTCI and NDVI. Then, the accuracy of MTCI for winter wheat yield prediction was examined and compared to the NDVI through a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The results show that (1) the correlation coefficient between yield and MTCI is significantly higher than that of models based on NDVI and the errors of models based on MTCI are lower than those of models based on NDVI except for milking stages. Moreover, the crop yield prediction model based on accumulated MTCI through the reviving stage to milking is most significantly correlated to crop yield with a coefficient of determination of 0.849 for MTCI; (2) the optimum phase for crop yield prediction based on MTCI is the heading stage, about 30 days earlier than that of NDVI (milking stage), which is another advantage of MTCI in crop yield prediction; and (3) the validation error of the crop yield model based on the accumulated MTCI is half of that based on the accumulated NDVI. The study indicates that MTCI is potentially a better VI for crop yield prediction compared to NDVI. },

abstract = {One of the primary interests of the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) program is to study the role of vegetation in biospheric processes. Currently, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is utilized to study and monitor vegetation activity on an operational basis at global scales. Recently developed variants to the NDVI equation, based on improved knowledge of atmosphere, canopy background, and sensor-view geometry, are being considered for use with the EOS Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor. A set of criteria is established to evaluate their performance with respect to the vegetation signal and atmospheric and soil sources of noise. These include the vegetation signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), \% relative error, and vegetation equivalent noise (VEN), which form the basis for the evaluation and comparison of vegetation indices (VIs) across a wide range in vegetation covers. The NDVI variant equations outperformed the NDVI by minimizing atmospheric and/or soil background sources of contamination as well as increasing vegetation signal sensitivity. Preliminary estimates, based on the data sets tested here, indicate an overall level of uncertainty of ± 0.4 LAI (≈ 15\% cover) with the use of the soil adjusted and atmospherically resistant vegetation index (SARVI), compared with ± 0.8 LAI (30\% cover) for the NDVI. Eventually, the final evaluation and validation of VIs for MODIS will include a field campaign strategy, simulation studies, and a worldwide establishment of test sites that collectively cover a diverse range of biomes. Lastly, the retrieval of canopy biophysical information from these VIs are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Several studies in the past have examined the spectral capability of multispectral and hyperspectral imagery for the identification of crop marks, while recent studies have applied different vegetation indices in order to support remote sensing archaeological applications. However, the use of vegetation indices for the detection of crop marks lacks in accuracy assessment and critical evaluation. In this study, 71 vegetation indices were indexed, from the relevant bibliography, and evaluated for their potential to detect such crop marks. During this study, several ground spectroradiometric campaigns took place, in a controlled archaeological environment in Cyprus, cultivated with barley crops, during a complete phenological cycle (2011–2012). All vegetation indices, both broadband and narrowband, were evaluated for their separability performance, and the results were presented through tables and diagrams. In the end, the use of more than one vegetation index is suggested in order to enhance the final results. In fact, several not widely used vegetation indices are suggested and evaluated using both Landsat TM and EO-1 Hyperion images.},

abstract = {In strip intercropping systems, different crop rows in a complete strip usually behave differently in growth dynamics and have distinct contribution to the final yield of the system, so resources capture and utilization processes of different crop rows should be treated separately in the performance evaluation of the whole system. This study was conducted to investigate the differences in light capture among different crop rows in wheat/maize strip intercropping systems. The field experiment comprised four planting patterns: monoculture wheat, monoculture maize, six rows of wheat alternated with two rows of maize (I62), and twelve rows of wheat alternated with four rows of maize (I124). A geometrical radiation transmission model was modified to estimate instantaneous light capture by different intercropped rows, which was tested with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured above and beneath the intercrop canopy. The results demonstrated that the model accurately predicted PAR transmitted through the canopy with mean absolute error, root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized RMSE of 60.2μmolm−2s−1, 82.6μmolm−2s−1 and 5.2\% respectively for I62 and of 65.9μmolm−2s−1, 95.3μmolm−2s−1 and 5.7\% respectively for I124. With assistance of the model, we found that border rows in wheat strip intercepted far greater amount of both direct and diffuse PAR than the inner rows, whereas maize border rows showed no advantage in PAR absorption due to its canopy development was constrained by the competition from wheat strip. Canopy structure character showed positive effects on radiation interception in wheat border rows and all maize rows, and plant phenotypic plasticity showed positive effects on wheat border rows but negative effects on maize border rows. The radiation transmission model presented in this work was proved to be a useful tool for calculating spatial and temporal variability of radiation in strip intercropping systems and it can be further served as a base for modeling the plant growth dynamics in strip intercrops.},

  abstract={Plant phenotyping investigates how a plant's genome, interacting with the environment, affects the observable traits of a plant (phenome). It is becoming increasingly important in our quest towards efficient and sustainable agriculture. While sequencing the genome is becoming increasingly efficient, acquiring phenotype information has remained largely of low throughput, since high throughput solutions are costly and not widespread. A distributed approach could provide a low cost solution, offering high accuracy and throughput. A sensor of low computational power acquires time-lapse images of plants and sends them to an analysis system with higher computational and storage capacity (e.g., a service running on a cloud infrastructure). However, such system requires the transmission of imaging data from sensor to receiver, which necessitates their lossy compression to reduce bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we propose an application aware image compression approach where the sensor is aware of its context (i.e., imaging plants) and takes advantage of the feedback from the receiver to focus bitrate on regions of interest (ROI). We use JPEG 2000 with ROI coding, and thus remain standard compliant, and offer a solution that is low cost and has low computational requirements. We evaluate our solution in several images of Arabidopsis thaliana phenotyping experiments, and we show that both for traditional metrics (such as PSNR) and application aware metrics, the performance of the proposed solution provides a 70% reduction of bitrate for equivalent performance.},

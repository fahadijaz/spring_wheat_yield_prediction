  abstract  = {The history of wheat domestication and use is closely linked to the efforts of humans to protect themselves from hunger and gain control over their food supply. Now grown worldwide wheat has become the most important source of food. For centuries bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) and durum wheat (Triticum durum) have been cultivated in the West to provide humans with energy and essential nutrients. Today China and India are the top two wheat-producing countries, largely because wheat has the advantage of requiring less water for cultivation than other comparable crops while being the main ingredient of a variety of processed foods valued in modern, mainly urban life. For more than a century, breeders have continuously improved wheat focusing on factors affecting grain yield and, more recently, technological quality. The properties of wheat that are ideal for processing into different food products have been greatly improved since the 1960s thanks to detailed research on storage proteins, which constitute the gluten. Most of these genetic successes are referred to in this book but many important goals remain to be achieved. Today further progress is crucial in the use of shared genetic resources, common analytical protocols for allele identification and technological processing, and dedicated tools for analysing polymer formation and characterisation particularly in response to climatic and other environmental factors. Technological properties are not the only wheat quality attributes, as consumers are increasingly aware and concerned about the nutritional value (the content in fiber, minerals, macro- and micro-nutrients, vitamins) and the health impact, whether positive or negative. For example, research on several pathologies associated with the consumption of gluten-based products will require collaboration between allergy specialists and wheat protein geneticists.},

  abstract = {Plant phenotyping investigates how a plant's genome, interacting with the environment, affects the observable traits of a plant (phenome). It is becoming increasingly important in our quest towards efficient and sustainable agriculture. While sequencing the genome is becoming increasingly efficient, acquiring phenotype information has remained largely of low throughput. Current solutions for automated image-based plant phenotyping, rely either on semi-automated or manual analysis of the imaging data, or on expensive and proprietary software which accompanies costly hardware infrastructure. While some attempts have been made to create software applications that enable the analysis of such images in an automated fashion, most solutions are tailored to particular acquisition scenarios and restrictions on experimental design. In this paper we propose and test, a method for the segmentation and the automated analysis of time-lapse plant images from phenotyping experiments in a general laboratory setting, that can adapt to scene variability. The method involves minimal user interaction, necessary to establish the statistical experiments that may follow. At every time instance (i.e., a digital photograph), it segments the plants in images that contain many specimens of the same species. For accurate plant segmentation we propose a vector valued level set formulation that incorporates features of color intensity, local texture, and prior knowledge. Prior knowledge is incorporated using a plant appearance model implemented with Gaussian mixture models, which utilizes incrementally information from previously segmented instances. The proposed approach is tested on Arabidopsis plant images acquired with a static camera capturing many subjects at the same time. Our validation with ground truth segmentations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in the literature shows that the proposed method is able to handle images with complicated and changing background in an automated fashion. An accuracy of 96.7% (dice similarity coefficient) was observed, which was higher than other methods used for comparison. While here it was tested on a single plant species, the fact that we do not employ shape driven models and we do not rely on fully supervised classification (trained on a large dataset) increases the ease of deployment of the proposed solution for the study of different plant species in a variety of laboratory settings. Our solution will be accompanied by an easy to use graphical user interface and, to facilitate adoption, we will make the software available to the scientific community.},

  abstract  = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100{\textendash}110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, \~{}1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO2-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching \~{}3 Gt y-1 and N use \~{}250 Mt y-1 by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only \~{}0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of \~{}1 Gt y-1, and global N use of \~{}225 Mt y-1. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

  abstract = {Crop production needs to increase in a sustainable manner to meet the growing global demand for food. To identify crop varieties with high yield potential, plant scientists and breeders evaluate the performance of hundreds of lines in multiple locations over several years. To facilitate the process of selecting advanced varieties, an automated framework was developed in this study. A hyperspectral camera was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect aerial imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution in a fast, cost-effective manner. Aerial images were captured in two consecutive growing seasons from three experimental yield fields composed of hundreds experimental wheat lines. The grain of more than thousand wheat plots was harvested by a combine, weighed, and recorded as the ground truth data. To investigate the yield variation at sub-plot scale and leverage the high spatial resolution, plots were divided into sub-plots using image processing techniques integrated by domain knowledge. Subsequent to extracting features from each sub-plot, deep neural networks were trained for yield estimation. The coefficient of determination for predicting the yield was 0.79 and 0.41 with normalized root mean square error of 0.24 and 0.14 g at sub-plot and plot scale, respectively. The results revealed that the proposed framework, as a valuable decision support tool, can facilitate the process of high-throughput yield phenotyping by offering the possibility of remote visual inspection of the plots as well as optimizing plot size to investigate more lines in a dedicated field each year.},
